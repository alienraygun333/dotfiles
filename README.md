BSPWM, AwesomeWM, and misc. dotfiles :)

Please let me know if you find any issues! This is my first time doing this, so something might be messed up.

!!AwesomeWM rofi theme is a work in progress

Installation:

 To install, 
 
 ``git clone https://github.com/alienraygun333/dotfiles``
 
 ``cd dotfiles``

 ``mv * ~/.config`` 

Beware, if you have pre-existing config files for any of the dependencies, you'll have to replace them to get this to work
